Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This delivery contains: 
	1) a tidy data set named data.txt
	2) a run_analysis.R that:
		Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
		Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
		Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
		Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
		From the data in previous step creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
	3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that have been performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
